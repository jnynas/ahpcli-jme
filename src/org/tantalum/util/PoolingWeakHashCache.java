/**
 * Objects stored in the WeakRefernce hash table may be garbage collected at any
 * time if the phone needs more memory. Explicit memory managment is also
 * supported such that any object manually remove()d from the cache is pooled
 * and can be re-used via getFromPool().
 *
 * This class can be useful for example with procedural graphics paint
 * acceleration where an re-paintable graphics object is pooled as it goes off
 * one edge of the screen and re-used for an equal sized object appearing at the
 * bottom of the screen. If sufficient memory is available, the WeakReference
 * hashtable also allows still-valid objects that were not explicitly removed
 * (such as those still on-screen) to be re-used without repainting, but if
 * other parts of the program need more memory temporarily they can bump these
 * cache objects out of memory.
