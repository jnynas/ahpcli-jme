/**
 * This is a hashtable which acts as a heap memory cache using WeakReference.
 *
 * Objects in the hashtable are not held in memory, they may be garbage
 * collected at any time, in which case the calling routine must do something
 * else to recreate the value. You can freely put as many objects in this cache
 * as you like, but do not store things of no interest as the objects will
 * displace more useful data.
 *
 * If an object is garbage collected, it will not be removed from the hash cache
 * automatically, so your app can count on this is a stable list of objects. You
 * may choose to manually remove references which will no longer be of interest
 * according to application logic.
 *
 * Since you do not have any control over which weak references are destroyed,
 * your application should be prepared to re-create data stored in this cache
 * without too much cost to user responsiveness.
 *
 * Placing a null object into the cache is the same as removing it- null values
 * are not stored as useful.
