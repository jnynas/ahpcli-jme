 * An object may implement both Workable and Closure to provide automatic passage
 * to the UI thread after completing a task on a Worker thread. This is used to
 * perform any UI cleanup. AsyncTask provides additional support for this
 * using a Java7-like fork-join pattern and an Android-like asynchronous
 * thread hand-off pattern and progress update pattern.
